## Microarrays-data-analysis

Repo includes scripts written in R markdown for Data proprocessing, DE analysis and GSEA on microarray data generated using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChip. The experiment was performed to quantify gene expression on breast cancer cell line for before and after treatment with the drug Tamoxifen. There are 5 replicates for each group. 

### Data 

Data is read into R using the ReadAffy() function from the '**hgu133acdf**' database. 

### Steps of Analysis

The scripts are written in R markdown and therefore the code is self explanatory with comments and description embedded in it.
